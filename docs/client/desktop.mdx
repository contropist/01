<Info>This client uses the [light](/server/light) server.</Info>

The desktop client for 01 provides a simple way to interact with the 01 light server using your computer. There are two main ways to use the desktop client:

## Simulating 01 Light Hardware

To simulate the 01 light hardware device on your desktop, run:

```
poetry run 01 --client
```

This will start the client in simulation mode. You can hold the CTRL key to talk to the 01 light server, simulating the button press on the physical device.

## Running Both Server and Client

To run both the server and client simultaneously, use:

```
poetry run 01
```

This command starts both the 01 light server and the desktop client, allowing you to interact with the system immediately. The client interface will guide you through the interaction process.
