<Info> Make sure that you have navigated to the `/software` directory. </Info>

To run 01 with your computer's microphone and speaker, you need to start a server and a client.

We abstract this away with a simple command:

```bash
poetry run 01
```

*Tip:* While in the `/software` directory, you can run the following command to install the `01` command system-wide:

```bash
pip install .
```

Then, simply run `01` in your terminal to start the server + client and begin speaking to your assistant.

```bash
01
```
