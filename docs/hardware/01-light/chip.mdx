For the 01 Light project, we've chosen the M5Atom, which features an ESP32 Pico chip. This compact and powerful microcontroller is ideal for our needs, offering built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, a microphone, speaker, and button.

To set up the M5Atom for use with 01 Light, please follow the instructions in our [ESP32 Setup Guide](client/esp32).
