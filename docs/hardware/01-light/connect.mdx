### Connecting your 01 device to the server

1. Start the 01 server on your computer:
   ```
   poetry run 01 --server light
   ```
   This command starts the server and generates a URL.

   For remote connections, use:
   ```
   poetry run 01 --server light --expose
   ```
   This generates a public URL accessible from anywhere.

2. Connect your 01 device to the server using one of these methods:

   a) Hardcode credentials:
   - Modify the Wi-Fi and server credentials at the top of the `client.ino` file.
   - Flash the modified file to the ESP32.
   - This method is quick but less flexible for changing details later.

   b) Use the captive portal:
   - Power on your 01 device.
   - Connect to the '01-light' Wi-Fi network from your computer or smartphone.
   - A captive portal page should open automatically. If not, open a web browser.
   - Enter your Wi-Fi details and the server URL from step 1.
   - Click 'Connect' to save settings and connect your device.

After successful connection, your 01 device will be ready to communicate with the server.
