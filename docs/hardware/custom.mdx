You can create custom hardware that integrates with the O1 server software running on your computer.

To use 01 with your custom hardware, run the livekit server and connect to the "Livekit is running at..." URL that is displayed:

```bash
poetry run 01 --server livekit
```

Or, run the light server and connect to the URL that is displayed:

```bash
poetry run 01 --server light
```

You may need to set additional parameters via [flags](/software/flags) depending on your setup.
