<Warning>This experimental project is under rapid development and lacks basic safeguards. Until a stable `1.0` release, **only run the 01 on devices without access to sensitive information.**</Warning>

The 01 is an experimental voice assistant that can execute code based on voice commands. This power comes with significant risks that all users must understand.

## Why Safety Matters

The 01 directly interacts with your system, executing code without showing it to you first. This means:

1. It can make changes to your files and system settings instantly.
2. Misinterpretations of your commands can lead to unintended actions.
3. The AI may not fully understand the context or implications of its actions.

Always approach using the 01 with caution. It's not your usual voice assistant â€“ **the 01 is a powerful tool that can alter your digital environment in seconds.**

<Warning>Remember: The 01 is experimental technology. Your safety depends on your understanding of its capabilities and limitations.</Warning>
