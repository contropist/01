The 01 voice assistant offers powerful control over your digital environment through natural language commands. 

However, this capability comes with **significant risks.** Understanding these risks is crucial for safe and responsible use of the 01.

This section outlines the key dangers associated with the 01's ability to execute code instantly based on voice input. Being aware of these risks is the first step in using the 01 effectively and safely.

## Immediate Code Execution

The 01 executes code directly based on voice commands, without showing you the code first. This means:

- Actions are taken instantly, giving you no chance to review or stop them.
- Misinterpretations of your commands can lead to immediate, unintended consequences.
- Complex or ambiguous requests might result in unexpected system changes.

## System and Data Vulnerability

Your entire system is potentially accessible to the 01, including:

- Important files and documents
- System settings and configurations
- Personal and sensitive information

A misinterpreted command could lead to data loss, system misconfiguration, or privacy breaches.

## Prompt Injection Vulnerability

The 01 processes text from various sources, making it susceptible to prompt injection attacks:

- Malicious instructions could be hidden in emails, documents, or websites.
- If the 01 processes this text, it might execute harmful commands without your knowledge.
- This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or system compromise.

## Lack of Context Understanding

While powerful, the 01's AI may not fully grasp the broader context of your digital environment:

- It might not understand the importance of certain files or settings.
- The AI could make changes that conflict with other software or system requirements.
- Long-term consequences of actions might not be apparent to the AI.

## Experimental Nature

Remember, the 01 is cutting-edge, experimental technology:

- Unexpected behaviors or bugs may occur.
- The full extent of potential risks is not yet known.
- Safety measures may not cover all possible scenarios.

Understanding these risks is crucial for safe use of the 01. Always err on the side of caution, especially when dealing with important data or system configurations.
