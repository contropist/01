    ### MacOS Installation

    1. **Git**: If you don't already have it, download and install Git from its [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

    2. **Python**: 
       - Download **Python 3.11.x** from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
       - During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH".

    3. **Poetry**: 
       - Follow the [official Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer).

    4. **FFmpeg and other dependencies**: 
       We recommend using Homebrew to install the required dependencies:

       ```bash
       brew install portaudio ffmpeg cmake
       ```

    ### Windows Installation

    1. **Git**: Download and install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

    2. **Python**: 
       - Download Python 3.11.x from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
       - During installation, ensure you check "Add Python to PATH".

    3. **Microsoft C++ Build Tools**:
       - Download from [Microsoft's website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
       - Run the installer and select "Desktop development with C++" from the Workloads tab.
       - This step is crucial for Poetry to work correctly.

    4. **Poetry**:
       - If the standard installation method fails due to SSL issues, try this workaround:
         1. Download the installation script from [https://install.python-poetry.org/](https://install.python-poetry.org/) and save it as `install-poetry.py`.
         2. Open the file and replace the `get(self, url):` method with:
            ```python
            def get(self, url):
                import ssl
                import certifi
                request = Request(url, headers={"User-Agent": "Python Poetry"})
                context = ssl.create_default_context(cafile=certifi.where())
                context.check_hostname = False
                context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
                with closing(urlopen(request, context=context)) as r:
                    return r.read()
            ```
         3. Run the modified script to install Poetry.
       - Add Poetry to your PATH:
         1. Press Win + R, type "sysdm.cpl", and press Enter.
         2. Go to the "Advanced" tab and click "Environment Variables".
         3. Under "User variables", find "Path" and click "Edit".
         4. Click "New" and add: `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts`
         5. Click "OK" to close all windows.

    5. **FFmpeg**:
       - Download the latest FFmpeg build from the [BtbN GitHub releases page](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases).
       - Choose the `ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl.zip` (non-shared suffix) file.
       - Extract the compressed zip file.
       - Add the FFmpeg `bin` folder to your PATH:
         1. Press Win + R, type "sysdm.cpl", and press Enter.
         2. Go to the "Advanced" tab and click "Environment Variables".
         3. Under "System variables", find "Path" and click "Edit".
         4. Click "New" and add the full path to the FFmpeg `bin` folder (e.g., `C:\path\to\ffmpeg\bin`).
         5. Click "OK" to close all windows.

   ## Troubleshooting

   1. **Poetry Install Error**: If you encounter an error stating "Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required" when running `poetry install`, make sure you have properly installed the Microsoft C++ Build Tools as described in step 3 of the Windows installation guide.

   2. **FFmpeg Not Found**: If you receive an error saying FFmpeg is not found after installation, ensure that you've correctly added the FFmpeg `bin` folder to your system PATH as described in step 5 of the Windows installation guide.

   3. **Server Connection Issues**: If the server connects but you encounter errors when sending messages, double-check that all dependencies are correctly installed and that FFmpeg is properly set up in your PATH.

    ### Linux Installation (Ubuntu)

    1. **Git**: If you don't already have it, install Git using:
       ```bash
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install git
       ```

    2. **Python**: 
       - Install Python 3.11.x using:
         ```bash
         sudo apt-get install python3.11
         ```

    3. **Poetry**: 
       - Follow the [official Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer).

    4. **FFmpeg and other dependencies**: 
       Install the required packages:

       ```bash
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev ffmpeg cmake
       ```

## Install 01

Now, clone the repo and navigate into the 01 directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/01.git
cd 01
```

Then, navigate to the project's software directory:

```bash
cd software
```

**Your current working directory should now be `01/software`.**

Finally, install the project's dependencies in a virtual environment managed by Poetry.

```bash
poetry install
```

Now you should be ready to [run the 01](/server/).

First, we recommend you familiarize yourself with our [safety report](/safety/).
